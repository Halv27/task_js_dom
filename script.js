    description: "The Persian is dignified and docile. They are known for being a quiet and affectionate breed. The cat is bred to have a round head, short face, snub nose, chubby cheeks, rounded ears, big eye and a sturdy body. They are going to require more grooming than many other cat breeds because of their fluffy, long fur. Although they are beautiful and sweet, Persians are prone to a number of potential health problems, most commonly related to their facial structure.",

      description: "One thing about the Maine Coon is that they’re big kitties! Some can tip the scales at over 20 pounds. They are native New Englanders, hailing from Maine where they have been a popular farm cat and mouser as far back as the early 19th century. Some believe they were brought to America by the Vikings and got their name because they resemble raccoons. Today this big, beautiful breed is one of the world’s most popular breeds.",
